      <h4>Myself</h4>

      <p>I am an analytical thinker who loves to develop software, and discuss technology 
      with peers. My most comfortable place in the workplace is within an energetic team that 
      is explorative, passionate about programming and fun. I take the quality of my work seriously, employing best 
      practices and up to date approaches to make likable code and reliable solutions.</p>

      <h4>ASOS <small>2011 - 2014</small></h4>

      <strong>Lead ALM Engineer</strong> - <small><i>PowerShell, Pester, MSBuild, SSDT, MSDeploy, Elasticsearch, AngularJS, Nancyfx</i></small>
      <p>
        Worked with the team to create a build and deployment framework
      in PowerShell which leveraged Psake, MSBuild, SSDT and other technologies. This helped to scale the engineering department from 60 to over 300 people by reducing the bottleneck in build, deployment and testing. We reduced building an
      environment from one week to 2 hours and dramatically increased the reliability and trust in the environments.
      Later on I introduced the team to collecting performance telemetry and log data across our cloud and analysing 
      them using Elasticsearch, D3 and AngularJS. We were able to optimise deployments to large environments and improve
      their success rate by looking at error logs in real-time. </p>

      <strong>Lead Engineer</strong> - <small><i>C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, WCF, NUnit</i></small>
      <p>Led a large team to perform a rapid and critical analysis of the main websites performance before
      Christmas peak. We retrospectively looked at previous downtime root causes, profiled the
      website under load and stored log and error data which we would later feed into sprints and tackle
      by priority. Based on the data we focused on reducing internal network load, garbage collections, unhandled exceptions and unnecessary logging. This required using in-memory caching and optimising SQL queries, code and IOC container calls. We successfully reduced network load and 
      CPU utilisation across the web and database servers which led to a smooth peak period.</p>

      <strong>Web Engineer</strong> - <small><i>Azure, WCF, NUnit, PostSharp</i></small>
      <p>Developed a RESTful API using WCF which was consumed by another team to connect the iOS apps
      to the ASOS backend services. I used my experience with large codebases to scaffold and undertake
      challenging refactorings needed to share code between the main website and the mobile API. We
      used PostSharp to simplify our cross-cutting concerns and created intuitive fluent 
      interfaces for interacting with Fredhopper. By promoting pair programming I was able to increase knowledge transfer
        and give mentorship to willing team mates.</p>

      <h4>Conchango / EMC Consulting <small>2007 - 2010</small></h4>

      <strong>Technical Consultant</strong> - <small><i>ASP.NET MVC, WCF, WPF, WinForms, SQL Server, NBehave</i></small>
      <p>Worked with various companies to build desktop windows applications, web applications and provide
      teams with mentorship and training on best practices and the .NET platform. During this time
      I also contributed to the NBehave open source project which I used to promote BDD and unit testing.</p>

      <h4>Royal Holloway University of London <small>2004 - 2007</small></h4>

      <strong>Computer Science BSc</strong>
      <p>Upper Second Class with Honours</p>

      <h4>Personal</h4>
      <p>I spend time outside of work reading the latest technical blogs, blogging about technology, 
      spiking out ideas and learning new platforms. I love both consuming and creating music and
      actively play guitar. I have further interests in traveling, photography, cycling and PC gaming.</p>
